# EmoSynth: Synthesizing Emotional States Through Neural Data Visualization

## Overview
EmoSynth is an innovative, data-driven animation platform designed to visualize the neural correlates of various emotional states and behaviors. Leveraging neuroscience research data, such as neural imaging and physiological signals, EmoSynth synthesizes dynamic animations that visually depict the brain's processing and expression of emotions. Aimed at educational purposes, enhancing emotional awareness, and aiding mental health therapies, EmoSynth offers visual insights into the complex interplay between brain activity and emotional experiences.

## Features
- **Dynamic Emotion-Based Neural Maps**: Interactive visualizations that reflect brain activity associated with different emotions.
- **Behavioral Correlation Animations**: Depictions of how emotional states correlate with observable behaviors and physiological responses.
- **Interactive Emotional Landscapes**: Users can explore emotional states to see their effect on brain function.
- **Comparative Views**: Visual comparisons of brain activities under contrasting emotional states.
- **Educational Content**: Narratives and guided tours explaining the neuroscience behind emotions and their regulation.

## Getting Started
To get started with EmoSynth, you'll need to set up your development environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites
- Unity3D
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- D3.js or Three.js (for web-based visualizations)
- Access to EEG/MEG/fMRI datasets

### Installation
1. Clone the EmoSynth repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hussainather/EmoSynth.git
```
2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas tensorflow pytorch
```
3. Set up your Unity3D project and import the EmoSynth Unity package.
